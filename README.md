## Introduction
Explore my project for the _dbt™ data modeling challenge - Movie Edition_, Hosted by [Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)! This project dives into the analysis of Science Fiction movies, using Natural Language Processing techniques to determine word frequency and sentiment of the plot of the movies. 

## Data Sources
My analysis leverages two key data sets:
- TMDB_MOVIES
- OMDB_MOVIES

## Methodology
#### Tools Used
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbt™.
- **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** for data storage and computing.
- **[Python]** for natural language processing.
- **[Python]** for data visualization.

#### Applied techniques
- I used SQL and dbt to create the base datamodels.
- I used python's NLTK package to apply Natural Language Processing to determine word frequency distribution and text sentiment of the plot of the movies. Created new tables in Snowflake and uploaded these metrics.
- I used SQL and dbt again to create all the final datamodels I used for visualzation.
- For visualization, like wordclouds and other charts, I used python.

## Visualizations

### Basic Metrics

My scope was Science Fiction movies and before I jumped into the advanced analytics I wanted a bit of context about this genre through some basic metrics.
