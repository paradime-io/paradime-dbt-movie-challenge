## Introduction
Explore my project for the _dbt™ data modeling challenge - Movie Edition_, Hosted by [Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)! 
This project dives into the analysis and visualization of Movie and TV data!

## Data Sources and Data Lineage

### Data Sources
My analysis leverages two key movies datasets provided by Paradime:
- OMDB_MOVIES.
- TMDB_MOVIES.

Additional datasets:
- [IMDB Movies]{https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/}: to provide people who worked in the movies and their role, and ratings.
- [Academy Awards]{https://github.com/DLu/oscar_data}: to provide detailed information about academy awards.
- [Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers]{https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0?years_option=all_years}: to calculate the present-day value of financial metrics adjusted by inflation.


### Data Lineage
